### CPSC 120

* Lab 7 Part 1

I like Lab 7, Part 1 because this lab teaches me how to write a program that calculates days between two dates. In this lab, I learned how to convert a Gregorian Calendar date to Julian Day by using a slightly modified Fliegel & Van Flandern algorithm. I also learned how to use command line arguments to enter beginning and end dates to calculate the number of days.  I learned how to convert command line arguments in argv into a modern C++ std::vector.  I also learned to use C++ standard library function std::stoi() which converts strings to integers. This lab also helps me to practice writing function definitions.

* Lab 8 Part 2

I like Lab 8, Part 2 because this lab teaches me how to write a program to calculate arithmetic mean which is widely used.  In this lab, I learned to write a program that stores values in a double or float variable.  I also learned to write a program to use floating point arithmetic to compute the average, so that the averages with decimal parts are calculated accurately.  This lab also teaches me to write programs that properly handle values that are negative or zero.  I also learned how to write a program that prints an error message if there is no command line argument and returns a non-zero exit code.

* Lab 10 Part 2

I like Lab 10, Part 2 because this lab teaches me how to write programs to create a two-dimensional data structure such as to organize California's population by county.  In this lab, I learned how to define each county name as a std::string.  I also learned how to define a C++ std::vector to store all the names.  Population data is numerical, and I learned how to store that information as integers.  I also learned about modular programming where different elements of a program are defined in different files.
